        <h3><a name="about"></a>About Me</h3>
      
        <p>I'm <strong>Andrew Harrison</strong>, a software and web developer currently living in Victoria, BC, Canada.</p>

        <p>Over the past 5+ years I have established myself as a generalist with a web focus, thanks to my experience working for companies with a variety of environments and pursuits. I am comfortable with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java, PHP, and SQL; additionally, I have some degree of familiarity with shell scripts, Python, Elixir, C#, and several non-relational databases (MongoDB, Neo4J, and RethinkDB). This breadth of exposure has helped me excel at translating patterns for performant, reliable, maintainable software across languages and frameworks. I feel at home in an Agile environment with continuous integration and am proficient in version control under Git.</p>

        <p>In addition to my technical abilities I am known for my exceptional communication skills, diligent attention to detail, and willingness to be a teacher or leader. I maintain a deep commitment to professional growth, constantly reading up on advances and issues in programming as well as engaging in hands-on experimentation.</p>

        <p>At this time, I'm especially interested in <strong>working remotely</strong>. This isn't just out of convenience. I am a strong proponent of asynchronous workflows, a fairly aggressive practitioner of Inbox Zero, and a constant presence in IRC and Google Chat. Moreover, while I will be living in Victoria for a little while longer, eventually I will need to move (most likely within North America) in support of my wife's career; my ideal outcome would be to maintain continuity in my own career and stay with a great company through any relocations. <em>Please note that I am a US citizen with an open work permit in Canada.</em></p>

        <p>MI5 is a web-based clone of the board game <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/438/scotland-yard">Scotland Yard</a>. Apart from my enjoyment of the game itself, my motivation for this project was to practice working with some libraries that I was already using (Dropwizard, Google Guice, jQuery) and to gain familiarity with some new libraries (Neo4J, Atmosphere, Google Maps, D3). Although there is still significant UI work to be done &ndash; particularly the routes between points, of which there are many, each to be drawn manually onto a map of a city known for its winding streets! &ndash; the current codebase encompasses a fully functional API, push notifications, and game logic governed by analysis of the backing graph database.</p>

        <h5>Autodidact <a href="https://github.com/cyranix/autodidact"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAKCAYAAACNMs+9AAAAVElEQVR42n3PgQkAIAhEUXdqJ3dqJ3e6IoTPUSQcgj4EQ5IlUiLE0Jil3PECXhcHGBhZ8kg4hwxAu3MZeCGeyFnAXp4hqNQPnt7QL0nADpD6wHccLvnAKksq8iiaAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"></a></h5>

        <p>I have recently spun up this repo to gather various toys or katas as I learn new languages and techniques. At present, the only project it contains is an exercise that I used for my first foray into functional programming with <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>: a cryptogram puzzle which runs from the REPL. Since writing that exercise, I have proceeded to develop two other projects of a more serious nature in Elixir (whose code is unfortunately not available at present), namely an implementation of <a href="http://www.datalab.uci.edu/papers/distributed_topic_modeling.pdf">approximate distributed latent Dirichlet allocation</a> and a text annotation tool for preparing custom corpora for NLP tasks.

        <h5>Security exercises</h5>

        <p>I am participating in the <a href="http://matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges">Matasano crypto challenges</a> (albeit in fits and spurts) and the <a href="http://course.daeken.com">Breaker 101 web security course</a>. In accordance with the stipulations of both activities, none of my output is posted online.</p>

        <h5>Rice University <small>August 2003 &mdash; May 2007</small></h5>

        <p>During university I earned a <strong>B.A. in Linguistics</strong>, with an emphasis in bilingualism and secondary language acquisition.</p>

        <p>My career in coding owes a lot to the Intro to Computer Science course that I took, oddly enough, for fun. I enjoyed the first semester of the course so much that I volunteered as a teaching assistant for it while taking the second half in the following semester. I don't doubt that my linguistics courses have helped me write better code, though &ndash; ask me how!</p>
